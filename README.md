## DocClusterizer

DocClusterizer is a Java desktop application designed to analyze and cluster documents based on their content similarity. The application utilizes Lucene and Tika libraries to process various file extensions such as txt, pdf, docx, and pptx. By extracting tokens and applying filtering techniques to remove stopwords in both English and Spanish, DocClusterizer creates a structured listing of documents and their associated tokens.

### Features

- **Document Processing:** DocClusterizer processes documents in different formats, extracting relevant tokens for further analysis.
- **Token Filtering:** Stopwords in English and Spanish are filtered out from the tokens to improve clustering accuracy.
- **Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms:** The application implements advanced unsupervised clustering algorithms including KMeans, FuzzyCMeans, and Linkage.
- **Intuitive Interface:** With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily load documents from a selected directory and apply clustering algorithms with a single click.

### Installation
